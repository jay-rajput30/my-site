       <p>A person's approach to learning is the very important factor in mastering any subject that he is interested in. That's why learning how to learn is such an important aspect. The books <strong>LIMITLESS</strong> by Jim Kwik changed my whole perspective about learning. I would like to share a few things that help me to understand and learn new things.</p>

       <h2>Active Recall and Spaced Repetition </h2>
       <p>This one plays a major role in how well I understand and retain the information. Once I go through some topic I try to summarize what I have learnt. This makes sure I am actively engaged in the topic I am learning not just cramming through the information. Also once I complete a good chunk of topic, I go back to it after a while and try to recollect as much information as possible.</p>

         <h2>Deliberate Practice </h2>
         <p>One the habit I have is skimming over the difficult part. It comes out of sheer comfort zone. But whenever this happens I try to force myself to sit uptight and break the topic into small group of concepts so that it becomes easy to grasp.</p>

      <section class="section"> 
       <h2>State while learning</h2>
       <p>Learning is state dependent. I make sure I sit in a proper posture and make sure that the I am consuming the most important topic of my life. If have observed that if I slouch and have no interest in the topic then I retain less information. </p>

      <section class="section"> 
       <h2>Active note taking</h2>
       <p>I make sure I have a goal in mind before I start making notes for any topic. Also I don't write down every bit of information on note, just the bullet points. Also I make sure I go over the notes once I have written them down just to make sure I have note missed out any information.</p>
